[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

# Exercise 4.2

#### The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

When you generate random numbers between 0 and 1000 using the numpy.random.random module the outputted numbers show a fairly uniform distribution. The CDF being a line a fairly unchanging slope between 0 and 1 and the PMF being flat give proof to this.

### Code used for outputting PMF and CDF plots for 1000 numbers from random.random 

```python

import thinkstats2
import numpy as np
import thinkplot

random_list = []
for x in range(1000):
    random_list.append(np.random.random())

pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(random_list)
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(random_list)

thinkplot.PrePlot(2,cols=2)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='PMF',
ylabel='Probability',)
thinkplot.PrePlot(2)
thinkplot.SubPlot(2)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='CDF')
```
